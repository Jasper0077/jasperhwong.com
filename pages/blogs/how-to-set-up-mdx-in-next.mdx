This idea at first was to create my own personal website, and I came across seeing lots of people using MDX in their portfolio website.

# But, what is MDX?

MDX is a combination of JSX (TSX) and MD (Markdown).
As usual, we can do `import` and `export` in `.mdx` file and we can write [link](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).
We can add `components` into our `.mdx` pages, like:

```
<Sparkles />
```

# Benchmarking

If you are considering, using `mdx` into your project, there are several ways to do it. This section will walk you through all the workarounds,
and you will know what's the best option for your preferences.

## next/mdx

If you are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) like I do, `next/mdx` could be a good choice for you.

### Configuration

The configuration is pretty simple, you need to first install the packages

```
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

And add the following to `next.config.js`.

```js
// next.config.js
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [],
    rehypePlugins: []
    // If you use `MDXProvider`, uncomment the following line.
    // providerImportSource: "@mdx-js/react",
  }
});
module.exports = withMDX({
  // Append the default value with md extensions
  pageExtensions: ["ts", "tsx", "js", "jsx", "md", "mdx"]
});
```

Then, it should work with `.mdx` files.

I like how components can be easily imported into `.mdx`. You just have to do something like this:

```md
import { MyComponent } from "my-components";

# My MDX page

This is a list in markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three

Checkout my React component:

<MyComponent />
```

```javascript
{
  `
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `;
}
```

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a YAML like key/value pairing that can be used to store data about a page.
Well, `@next/mdx` does not support frontmatter by default, though there are many solutions for adding frontmatter to your MDX content, such as gray-matter.

## next-mdx-remote

By the time, I started exploring a solution for **Frontmatter**, I saw `next-mdx-remote` by [Hashicorp](https://github.com/hashicorp).
`next-mdx-remote` gets the content, render a static version and hydrate it back during render.
We can keep our frontmatter, but we need to drop anything else. But, to import components, you have to do it differently.
We need to pass the components to the context, and components will be passed down to the `.mdx` pages. It does support [next/dynamic](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import),
to improve the performance.

But, I don't like the idea of dumping every single component into the global context, even though it provides you a granular control over your components.

## next-mdx-enhanced

This package is considered deprecated, and the team is migrating to `next-mdx-remote` by even enhancing it.

# Styling

Few options are out there for styling your `mdx`.

## Tailwindcss

This library is one of the hottest css framework that you might heard of most recently, it changed the way of how we use css.
It provides a list of css utility classes for user to define the intended css properties underhood. But, styling with this within your project,
can be less readable. But, if you are considering building something from scratch which is highly customizable, it is the right option for you.
I use heavily with Tailwindcss over the other options (even though I used some of them in my project) is solely because I want to learn css.
It's very convenient to style your `mdx` blogs. Say, we might have something like this, the blog source will be first
compiled down though to `html` from `mdx` then be passed into the `MDXRemote` context provider. So, I use `@tailwindcss/typography` which provides
all ready-to-use css setting to format typography in just a single magic css class: `prose`.

```jsx
<section
  className={cn(
    "prose dark:prose-dark prose-sm sm:prose-base lg:prose-lg \
    text-justify max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-16"
  )}
>
  <MDXRemote {...source} components={components} />
</section>
```

## Theme-UI

I believe this is one of the best solution out there which is highly compatibile with `mdx`. It's a Component based css framework, which provides
bunch of readily components which can be also overwritten by passing `props` to customize it.

## Styled-components

This project used `styled-components` as well. It's pretty convenient to style your components to make it more
readable (at least better than tailwincss).

# Implementation

Now, after we understand all the dependencies, we can finally start building our `mdx` site. To start off with, choose
the right `mdx` provider solution based on your preferences. Normally, the typical workflow for this will be:

1. Installation: normally `npm install` the solution you need.
2. Configuration: Which includes setting up your `mdxProvider`, `mdx-loader` etc.
3. Metadata Handling: This is to handle the metadata for each blog posts.
4. Styling: This includes using some `css` library and plugin extension to make your blog looks prettier.
