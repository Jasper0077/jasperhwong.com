# The Story

It is when I am starting to implement my own Modal component using in this project. But, something weird happened when I am exploring with css.

```js
export const Modal = ({ open, children }: ModalProps) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={cn(
        !open && "hidden",
        "fixed top-0 left-0 right-0",
        "backdrop-blur-sm",
        "z-10 w-full p-4 overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-auto md:inset-0 h-[calc(100%-1rem)] md:h-full"
      )}
    >
      <div className="relative max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        <div className="relative bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md">
          {children}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

So, I have created this Modal component, and it looks pretty dang good. I use a demo page to test my component out happily.
It looks pretty good when I do this.

```js
// ...
return (
  <>
    <Button
      onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}
      variant="primary"
      size="medium"
      className="fixed top-250 left-500 z-3"
    >
      Open
    </Button>
    <Modal open={open}>
      <ModalHeader title="This is a modal" handleClose={() => setOpen(!open)} />
      <ModalContent>
        <p>
          sample texts go here. Width always look down to find the maximum width
          of its children. Height backtrace upwards to find the height of its
          parent.
        </p>
      </ModalContent>
      <ModalFooter>
        <Button>Click</Button>
      </ModalFooter>
    </Modal>
  </>
);
// ...
```

<Image

  src={
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasper0077/jasperhwong.com/main/public/assets/stackingContext/normal-dom-order.png"
  }
  width={1200}
  height={600}
/>

There are a few things I can tweak.

### Non-positioned vs Positioned Element

So, what I did here is remove the position rule from my Modal. I append the Button component right after the Modal under the same hierarchy in the DOM tree.
And notice what happened?

```js
// Modal component
return (
  <div
    className={cn(
      !open && "hidden",
      "top-0 left-0 right-0",
      "backdrop-blur-sm",
      "z-10 w-full p-4 overflow-x-hidden overflow-y-auto md:inset-0 h-[calc(100%-1rem)] md:h-full",
      className
    )}
  >
    <div className="relative max-w-2xl mx-auto">
      <div className="relative bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-900 rounded-lg shadow-md">
        {children}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);
// ...
```

```js
// ...
return (
  <>
    <Modal open={open}>// modal content...</Modal>
    <Button>Open</Button>
  </>
);
// ...
```

<Image
  alt="Non positioned DOM Order view"
  src={
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jasper0077/jasperhwong.com/main/public/assets/stackingContext/non-positioned-dom-order.png"
  }
  width={1200}
  height={700}
/>

Okay, since I removed the `position: fixed` rule from Modal component, it will flow within the parent as a pure `flow` layout element.
And, now the button is clickable. The backdrop is no longer preventing us to click the button.
But, we still have the `z-index: 10` right? Well, even if we define a `z-index` for the Modal, but it won't work.

<aside>z-index doesn't apply to flow layout!</aside>

This introduces [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).

Stacking context can be created by [several ways](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context),
to mention a few:

- `<html>` itself is a stacking context.
- Element with `position` value other than `static` and have a `z-index` other than `auto`.
- Element with `position: fixed` or `position: sticky`.
- Element with `flex` or `grid` and having a `z-index` other than `auto`.

<h3>...</h3>

So, in our case since we remove the `position` value for both element, how does css determine it? The DOM order.
The DOM order of the elements within the same parent matters, the latter one will overlap the former one and the same goes to nested tree.

Generally, this will be the rule when deal with z-index and stacking context:

- When all siblings are rendered in Flow layout, the DOM order controls how the background elements overlap, but the content will always be at the front.
- If one sibling uses positioned layout, it will overlap the non-positioned one regardless of the DOM order.
- If both siblings use positioned layout, the DOM order controls which element will be on top. And content of it doesn't float to the front.
- Z-index only works for positioned element.
- Elements from different stacking context will not affecting each other. (We will get to this later)

Feel free to play around with the sandbox below to test out.

<CodeSandbox codeSandboxId="stacking-context-demo-gl449e" />

### Stacking Context

So, we mentioned about elements from different stacking contexts will not affect each other and this is
literall what context means. Since, elements come from different context, only siblings from the same context will affect
their behaviour.

Precisely, it's the `z-index`. No matter how much `z-index` we give to the element, it won't float over the element from other context.
But, the rules that we had discussed about still apply, and soley depends on their parent. Let's take a look on an example.

<CodeSandbox codeSandboxId="stacking-context-with-diff-parent-ocoq9i" />

<aside>Try toggle on off the `isolation` value and see what happens.</aside>

So, what happened is that, the pricing section and the header belongs to the same stacking context (remember the `html` tag itself is a stacking context). So, the `z-index` value
for pricing group and header are compared against each other. How can we solve this?

I can at least think of three ways based on our previous discussions:

1. Use `position: relative` and `z-index` for `.pricing`.
2. Move the DOM order of the header, place it after the pricing section.
3. Use `isolation: isolate`.

The `isolation` properties does exactly only one thing, creates a stacking context.
When we toggle on the `isolation` property for pricing section, the pricing section is recognised as
a non-positioned element. And since positioned element will always float on top of non-positioned element,
not only the `z-index` won't be compared against the header one and the header will always be on top of the pricing section.

### Portal

Now, let's head back to the implementation of Modal right now. So, what's a better way to build a Modal?
Actually, not just Modal, but other global UI components with certain positioned-like value like toolbar, Dialog, Loading Spinner and Backdrop.
How can we minimize the regression of facing the frustration from stacking context? Especially, when our DOM tree is deeply nested,
and we used `z-index` almost everywhere, how can we best handle that? One way that I can think of is using portal.

Portal is actually an API pattern used by most component driven framework like React, Svelte. This section is going to show how we can build our
Modal with Portal in React, Next.js.

What is Portal? Portal in React lets you place your children out of the React DOM without losing the React Context.
To create portal, we can use `createPortal` from `import ReactDOM from "react-dom"`.

Normally, this will work in React or at least `create-react-app`.

```js
import { createPortal } from "react-dom";
// ...
<div>
  <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
  {createPortal(
    <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,
    document.body
  )}
</div>;
```

But, when we are working in Next.js, SSR doesn't recognise `document` object. `document` is only meant for browser side.
So, we would need additional tweak to handle that.

We would need to make sure the `JSX.Element` is mounted. So, we can deal with it as a browser side render.

```ts
// Portal.tsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

export interface PortalProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Portal = ({ children }: PortalProps) => {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = React.useState(false);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);

    return () => setMounted(false);
  }, []);

  return mounted
    ? ReactDOM.createPortal(
        children,
        document.querySelector("#portal") as HTMLElement
      )
    : null;
};

export default Portal;
```

Next, we can use it to wrap our Modal component using HOC Pattern.

```ts
// ...
<Portal>
  <Modal>/** other stuffs... */</Modal>
</Portal>
```

And finally, we need to let Next.js to identify where to render our JSX.
So, we will add `<div id="portal"></div> for that. And, `createPortal` will handle the rest.

```ts
// _document.tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from "next/document";

export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html lang="en">
      <Head>/** other stuffs... */</Head>
      <body className="bg-white dark:bg-black text-black dark:text-white isolate">
        <Main />
        <div id="portal"></div>
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  );
}
```
