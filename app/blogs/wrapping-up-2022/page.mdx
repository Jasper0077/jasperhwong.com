# Introduction

A lot of things happened this year... Few things like Edge Computing, Metaverse, Server Components, ChatGPT, and
new Javascript frameworks are still emerging. For the purpose of recording everything I had learned, I am writing this as a testimony of my growth.

# Web Dev

I never tried [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) before until this year. Once I learned it... yeah it was lit. Typescript brings Javascript up to a
whole new level for sure. I like the auto-completion, static typing (like type inference), compile time checking... One of the highest
ROI tech I have learned.

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is one of my most confident framework for building web app currently. If you don't know what you are building and is a React fan,
then Next.js won't be the worst option for you I guess. It supports all kinds of rendering pattern, SEO improvement, js library, speedy performance,
and being one of the most famous framework (at least at that time while I am still writing this).

## Styling

Styling plays a crucial part in frontend dev. There are few [paradigms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouncVBiye_M) specifically for React app.

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): Tailwindcss by far is my favorite. Utiliy class, highly customizable, reusable, and easy write.
  But it requires some additional config, big commitment. I used it for this project, because I can learn write css from scratch and get familiarized with it.
- Global.css: I have tried it, it's just an external css.
- CSS Preprocessor: Like Sass, Stylus, you can use variable, function and compile down to css. I didn't really touch these much, but it's worth trying I guess.
- CSS in JS: One option being [Styled-components](https://styled-components.com/), highly customizable and is coupled with JSX code.
- CSS Library: Lots of option out there, I tried [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [MUI](https://mui.com/), and these options get maintained and supported frequently.
  But there are few contender as well, notably [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/) (I wanna try this, you can see how people write components and create their design system,
  but it's not free üôÅ. So, I'm still considering), [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/) (cute! ü•∞)

## MDX

While I am researching about building my own personal website (a [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/)), people recommended using `.mdx` for writing posts.
There are few tech stack to build this, like Next.js (I am using this). But, actually there are even better option:

- HUGO: Fastest static site-generator framework.
- Gastby.js: Static site-generator frameowrk for React.js, best for building JAMstack.
- Nuxt.js: For Vue.js.
- Angular.js
- Jekyll: For Ruby.
- Docusaurusr: Mostly for writing documentation.

The reason I choose Next.js, is simply because I learned React and I don't want my perosnal website just to be a blog. BUt, I actually think of scaling it
into my own digital garden. I want to explore different stuffs, like Graphql, some cool libraries, rendering pattern, i18n, ARIA, Auth paradigms,
CSS paradigms and so on. But, before choosing you stack, you need to consider a few things for your application.
[Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/posts/rendering-introduction/) describes this well and I recommend you to take a look.

## libraries

Yeah, Web dev is not a rocket science üöÄ. For me, it's more like a piece of art. Basically, we use exisiting solutions from the other to solve our problems.
So, I have used a lot of libraries in this year. These are some of them...

- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
- Validation libraries: Options are [validate.js](https://validatejs.org/), [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup), [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod),
  [Joi](https://joi.dev/api/?v=17.7.0)
- [Formik](https://formik.org/): Declarative form builder libraries.
- Cronjob: You don't have to do a AWS Lambda, use [Bree.js](https://github.com/breejs/bree) to run cronjob or scheduler in you Nodejs app.
- PDF: [JsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF), no that good but I can't find a better one.
- Rich Text editor: I have tried [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org/), [Quil.js](https://quilljs.com/), both have their own pros and crons to summarise,
  [see more](https://blog.bitsrc.io/top-5-rich-text-editors-for-react-in-2021-628fecf0f7e0).
- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

## Auth

For hashing, I recommend this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/password-hashing-pbkdf2-scrypt-bcrypt-and-argon2-e25aaf41598e) written by Michael.
For auth strategies, this [site](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) gives us some options to choose from. I only used JWT and OAuth. OAuth is complex, but safer and better.
Watch [this](https://supertokens.com/blog/oauth-vs-jwt).

## API Protocol and API Tools

This bit is one of my biggest takeaway during this year. Again, few [options](https://stoplight.io/api-types) out there.

- SOAP
- JSON-rpc
- RESTful API

But I want to share how the following two can change the game of how we used to do api calls. Technically, these two aren't web api protocol.

- Graphql: This is a language for querying your API. You get what you asked for, _nothing much, nothing less_, **typesafe** and _caching_. And this solve the problem of overfetching (most common issue for RESTful API).
- Trpc: Typescript powered end-to-end type safe API (but only for fullstack Typescript project). And the moment I tried this, I like it!

Other Tools like [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/overview) from Tanstack, [useSWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) by Vercel can boost the performance of making API calls.
Doing API calls is an art, and is vital for frontend developer.

## Backend Technologies

Actually, there are a lot to write about here. But, most recently, I am learning way to host a database (hosting providers), FaunaDB, Apollo, Prisma and Bun.

# DevOps

This bit includes a lot of things, like AWS, Docker, Kubernets, Terraform, CircleCI, Jenkins and TravisCI are all on my bucket list.
I am still learning these technologies and are trying build my own architecture with all these tools.

# Others

Nothing important here actually, I also learned other stuffs like... embedding a CodePen.

## Leetcode

I have been doing Leetcode for more than half a year, and is still continuining untill I get my Leetcode T-shirt,
participated in competition (still aiming for this, if I didn't give up?), hired by big tech (initially was part of my plan).
At first, I was doing this for the sake of getting into FAANG, but it ended up becoming my hobby recently, I am collecting the badges and
climbing the rank now. I think Leetcode really did a great to gamify the coding experience as a motivation.

## Blockchain

I used to learn Blockchain, like Solidity. But, I gave up because I realised I was too greedy to learn everything. Instead, I should just focus on
something first? Right now, it will be Frontend Dev > DevOps > Backend Dev > Three.js (if I have the bandwith üò¢).

## Self Education

- [Creative Coding](https://github.com/terkelg/awesome-creative-coding)
- [Patterns.dev](https://www.patterns.dev/)
- [Ebooks](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books)
- [Algorithms](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms)
- [Udemy](https://udemy.com): My best site to start learning new thingsüòÉ.

## Tools

- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/): for personal information management system.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Actually, I should put this in above section.
  But anyways, this is for implementing design system, I just started using it to build my own one now.

# Final Thoughts

Thank you for spending time watching my post. Thanks for bearing with my terrible English and grammar? English is not my mother tongue,
and I am still learning it. Please feel free to leave a comment or subscribe to my newsletter? (no such feture yet at the time when I am writing this post, but maybe in future?)

Best Regards,
