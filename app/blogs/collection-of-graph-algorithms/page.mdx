Graph problems are interesting and fun. It's my favourite coding problem variant of all times!

This post is inspired by a Leetcode [post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1326900/graph-algorithms-problems-to-practice).

# Terminology

First, let's talk about some terminologies that we will use for the rest of the content.

1. Graph: A graph in dscrete mathematics is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of objects are in some sense "related".
2. Vertex/vertices: A vertex is a single object abstraction (or we normally call it a node) in a graph.
3. Edge/edges: An edge is a line connecting two node/vertices in a graph. An edge can be directed or undirected. An directed edge from A to B, is strictly irrevisible from B to A. Whilst, undirected edge between A and B can be travelled from both ends.
4. Weighted graph: An weighted graph is a type of graph whereby a number is assigned to each edge. Such weight can be represented as certain value like cost, time, capacities, etc.
5. Bipartite graph: A bipartite graph is a graph where all nodes can be divided into two sets, say W and X. So that, no two nodes in W share a common edge, as well as X.
6. Tree: A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly on path, or sometimes a connected acyclic undirected graph.

## Generate a Graph

Depends on the input that the question has provided, normally the inputs will be an array of `edges`, to represent the connectivity of all nodes.
Below, is an example of generating an `adjacency list` to represent undirected graph.

```python
graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
for u, v in paths:
    graph[u].append(v)
    graph[v].append(u)
```

We have two famous traversal algorithm to solve a graph problem. A traversal algorithm can be defined as an algorithm to search a node or traverse from node to node.

## Depth First Search

A DFS can be implemented by using a recursive function. So, based on the graph that we have generated above,

```python
    visited = set()

    def dfs(node):
        if node not in visited:
            visited.add(node)
            # Do something here
            for v in graph[u]:
                dfs(node)
        return
```

We use a `set` here to make sure we won't visit a visited node again in `O(1)` time.

## Breath First Search

A BFS tends to look for the neighbouring nodes first, and then visit the subsequent degree nodes. Hence, we often say it is visiting nodes layer by layer.
Since, its nature of visiting nodes from the first degree, it is often used to search for a shortest target/node. We use a queue or priority queue to implement a BFS.

```python
    visited = set()
    bfs = collections.deque([startNode])

    while bfs:
        u = bfs.popleft()
        if u == target:
            # Do something
            return True
        visited.add(node)
        for v in graph[u]:
            if v not in visited:
                bfs.append(v)

    return False
```

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's Algorithm is used to find a shortest paths between a given node (starting node) to other nodes in a graph.
This algorithm uses the weights of the edges to find the path that minimize the total distance between the source and other nodes.
It utilizes a `priority queue` and will always process the smallest edge's cost in the heap. Thus, we are able to produce the optimal cost to reach the target node.
Below shows an example from network delay problem in a directed graph.

```python
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in times: # source, dest, cost
            graph[u].append((w, v))

        pq = [(0, k)]
        dist = [float(inf)] * (n)
        visited = set()
        dist[k] = 0

        while pq:
            w, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if u in visited: continue
            visited.add(u)
            if dist[u] < w: continue
            for v, cost in graph[u]:
                if dist[v] > dist[u] + cost:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (dist[v], v))
        res = max(dist[1:])
        return res if res != float('inf') else -1
```

## Union Find

Union–find data structure or disjoint-set data structure or merge–find set, is a data structure that stores a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets.
Equivalently, it stores a partition of a set into disjoint subsets. It provides operations for adding new sets, merging sets (replacing them by their union), and finding a representative member of a set.
It helps to find the number of connected components, and can help to find MST.

Union Find has two optimizations:

1. Union by rank
2. Path compression

Below, shows a Union Find template without rank and path compression.

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
       self.root = [i for i in range(n)]
    def find(self, x):
        if x == self.root[x]: return x
        return self.find(self.root[x])
    def union(self, x, y):
        X, Y = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if X != Y: self.root[X] = self.root[Y]
```

And now see a template with union by rank and path compression. Rank here is referring to the size of the root.

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.root = [i for i in range(n)]
        self.size = [1] * n
    def find(self, x):
        if x == self.root[x]: return x
        self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x])
        return self.root[x]
    def union(self, x, y):
        X, Y = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if X != Y:
            if self.size[X] > self.size[Y]:
                self.size[X] += self.size[Y]
                self.root[Y] = X
            else:
                self.size[Y] += self.size[X]
                self.root[X] = Y
```

## Bipartite Graph

Bipartite Graph is a type of graph where all its node can be divided into two disjointed set U and V,
that is every vertex in U is connected to one vertex in V. And note that bipartite graph doesn't contain odd-length cycles (cycle with odd number of edges).
Because, there is only stricly two parts U and V, and vertex in U can only connect to V but not U and vice versa.
Bipartite graphs are extensively used in modern coding theory, especially to decode codewords received from the channel. Factor graphs and Tanner graphs are examples of this

We can use DFS to identity a Bipartite Graph. For example, [Leetcode 785: Is Graph Bipartite?](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite/).

```python
    self.seen, self.mapping = set(), {}
    def dfs(i, group):
        if i in self.seen and self.mapping[i] != group: return False
        if i not in self.seen:
            self.seen.add(i)
            self.mapping[i] = group
            for j in graph[i]:
                if not dfs(j, not group): return False
        return True

    for i in range(len(graph)):
        if i not in self.seen:
            if not dfs(i, True):
                return False
    return True
```

1. Here, we use `True` or `False` to represent the two parts which is U and V.
2. By using a Top-down approach, we recursively if the current vertex belongs to the right part.
3. If it doesn't or the next subsequent vertex doesn't, we then return False.
4. Either one vertex that doesn't meet the Bipartite requirement will then result as False.

By using the similar method, we can also solve [Leetcode 886: Possible Bipartition?](https://leetcode.com/problems/possible-bipartition/).

## Topological Sort

Top Sort (in short) is a linear ordering of vertices, such that every directed edges uv from vertex u to vertex v, u always comes before v in the ordering.

To implement a top sort, we would need to array,

1. indegrees array: stores the indegree value for each vertex, for example if U comes beofre V, V has +1 indegree.
2. adjacency list: stores all the directed edges (uv) for all vertex U to vertex V.

We utilize bfs to implement the top sort.

1. Firstly, add vertex with zero indegree.
2. And we iterate through one by one, and each vertex in the queue, we look for the next vertex it is pointing to.
3. Then, minus the that netx vertex's indegree by 1.
4. If the next vertex now has a zero indegree, we add it to the queue.
5. And repeat the steps above.

Below shows the code snippet of one of my favourite question [Leetcode 207: Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)

```python
    graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
    inDegrees = [0] * numCourses
    for u, v in prerequisites:
        graph[u].append(v)
        inDegrees[v] += 1
    bfs = [x for x in range(numCourses) if inDegrees[x] == 0]
    for node in bfs:
        for neig in graph[node]:
            inDegrees[neig] -= 1
            if inDegrees[neig] == 0: bfs.append(neig)
    return True if len(bfs) == numCourses else False
```

## Bellman-Ford Algorithm

BF algorithm is a Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) algorithm. However, BF is not ideal because it has a less optimized performance comparing to Dijkstra.
However, Dijkstra's algorithm can fail when the grpah has negative edge weights.

Now, let's see how we can implement BF algorithm,

- E = number of edges
- V = number of vertices
- S = the id of starting node
- D = the array of size V that tracks the best distance from S to each node.

1. Set every entry in D to infinity
2. Set D[S] = 0
3. Relax each edge V - 1 times with:

```python
for _ in range(V - 1):
        if dist[U] + w < dist[V]:
            dist[V] = dist[U] + w
```

So, if we reuse the same Leetcode network delay question, we will have this

```python
dist = [float('inf') for _ in range(n)]
dist[k - 1] = 0
for _ in range(n - 1):
    for u, v, w in times:
        if dist[u - 1] + w < dist[v - 1]:
            dist[v - 1] = dist[u - 1] + w
return max(dist) if max(dist) < float('inf') else -1
```

Notice that, the order of the `dist` array doesn't matter at all.

## Floyd Warshall Algorithm

Floyd Warshall revolves around the idea of "Can we do it better for the dist(u, v) when introduce a node `k`, `dist(u, k) + dist(k, v) < dist(u, v)`?

```python
dist = [[inf for i in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
for i in range(n):
    dist[i][i] = 0
for u, v, w in edges:
    dist[u][v] = w
    dist[v][u] = w
for k in range(n):
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
res = { sum(d <= distanceThreshold for d in dist[i]): i for i in range(n) }
return res[min(res)]
```
